# API Permissions Documentation Summary

## Date: October 18, 2025

## Overview

Added comprehensive documentation and user guidance regarding the requirement to use the `support` username (or equivalent elevated permissions) for successful report generation due to API permission requirements.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Main README.md

#### Authentication Requirements Section
**Added**:
- Explicit requirement for `support` user or equivalent
- Clarification that standard users may have insufficient permissions
- Note about elevated read access requirements

**Before**:
```markdown
### Authentication Requirements
- **VAST Credentials**: Valid VAST cluster credentials with read access
- **Permissions**: Read-only access to cluster configuration and status information
```

**After**:
```markdown
### Authentication Requirements
- **VAST Credentials**: Valid VAST cluster credentials with elevated read access
- **Required Username**: `support` user or equivalent with full read permissions
- **Permissions**: Comprehensive read access to cluster configuration, hardware, and status information
- **API Access**: VAST REST API v7 support (VAST cluster version 5.3+)
- **Note**: Standard user accounts may have insufficient permissions for complete report generation
```

#### Usage Examples
Added comments to all usage examples indicating support username requirement:
- Interactive mode: "Use 'support' username for full API access"
- Command-line mode: "Note: Use 'support' username or equivalent for full report generation"

#### Troubleshooting Section
**Added New #1 Issue**: Insufficient API Permissions

```markdown
**1. Insufficient API Permissions**
Error: API request failed with 403 Forbidden
Error: Incomplete data - missing hardware/network information

Solution: Use the `support` username or an account with equivalent elevated read permissions

Required Permissions:
- Read access to /api/v7/clusters/
- Read access to /api/v7/cnodes/, /api/v7/dnodes/
- Read access to /api/v1/cboxes/, /api/v7/dboxes/
- Read access to network, tenant, and policy endpoints
```

---

### 2. Updated docs/README.md

#### Quick Start Section
Added note to example command:
```bash
python3 -m src.main --cluster-ip <CLUSTER_IP> --username <USERNAME> --password <PASSWORD> --output-dir reports
# Note: Use 'support' username for full API permissions
```

#### Common Issues Section
**Enhanced with Permission Guidance**:
```markdown
**Report Generation Issues**:
- Verify cluster connectivity
- **Use 'support' username for full API access**
- Check credentials and permissions
- Review API version compatibility
- Ensure elevated read permissions for all endpoints

**Permission Errors**:
- Standard user accounts may lack sufficient API permissions
- Report generation requires comprehensive read access
- Use `support` user or equivalent elevated account
```

3. Check API access
4. Review logs
5. Contact support

#### Section 9: FAQ
**8 Common Questions**:
- Can I use regular user account?
- What if I don't have support password?
- Does tool modify cluster?
