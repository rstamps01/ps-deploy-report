Content: Manus AI Query Log
Project: ps-deploy-report
Updated: 9/12/25

Write a description of the optimal AI persona for developing code that uses API calls and python to generate an as-built report after professional services have installed a VAST Data cluster.  The report should be formatted in logical sections and professionally formatted so that it can be provided to customers following successful deployment.

Next, define clear guardrails for the AI to work within during the development effort with the target outcome resulting in code consistency, exception handling, fault tolerance, and logging to assist professional services in correcting any issues impacting successful report generation.

Assess the information available through the VAST API version 7 for VAST Cluster 5.3 and identify the information that will be most applicable for this report.

Next, create a project requirements document and project plan for this development effort.

Using the information above, generate an AI development reference guide to ensure clear understanding of objectives, consistency in code development, and effective transitions between tasks which reach context limit and context is inherited into a new task.  If possible, add instructions to maintain and update a status tracking log which can be referenced to quickly pick-up from where a previous task leaves off in the development effort.  All code should be maintained in the following Github repo and reviewed or referenced at the beginning of each new task via SSH - git@github.com:rstamps01/ps-deploy-report.git

Outline the initial development tasks and populate the STATUS.md log as per the guide.

Generate the code for Task 1.1.1: Repository Initialization

Generate the code for Task 1.1.2: Development Environment Setup.

Review the attached file outlining additional targeted data points for the report.  Analyze the VAST API (version 7 for cluster 5.3) to identify information that can be gathered through the API and what information would need an alternate method to gather.

Review the following API calls and update the api research findings and vast api analysis:
Rack heights for all hardware
- See Schema/CBox/index_in_rack
- See Schema/DBox/index_in_rack
Cluster PSNT
- See Schema/Cluster/psnt

Review the Product Requirement Document, Project Plan, Initial Development Tasks, and AI Development Reference Guide.  Append each to reflect additional API data points where applicable. Next, generate a design guide reflecting project implementation methodologies, data points and content to be gather and included in the report, APIs calls identified for data gathering, and recommended report layout and formatting.

Review the attached Product Requirement Document and append to reflect additional API data points where applicable. 

Update the Project Plan to reflect the additional API data points and enhanced requirements from the PRD v1.1.

Generate a mock-up of the as-built report with physical layout visualization.

Review the attached presentation and use it as a reference for the rack layout and network diagram.  Note that the NVMe or IB switch fabric connects Frontend CBoxes to backend DBoxes in a direct attached share everything (DASE) architecture.  Connections to the customer network can be done either through a secondary Dual Port NIC from CBoxes or Switch to Switch MLAG connections from the NVMe or IB switch fabric.  Both Leaf and Spine / Leaf network architectures are supported.  Revise mock-up report accordingly.

Review this diagram as it represents proper network connectivity.  Switch pair is shown in the center with at least two switch to switch uplink connections (most deployments use Mellanox).  One or more CBoxes (CBox represents external chassis) includes one or more CNodes (CNode represents compute node) and manage all data processing and data services.  The attached example diagram includes a CBox with four CNodes at the top of the diagram.  CNodes connect to the switch fabric and can also connect to the customer's core switching Network with secondary high speed dual NICs.  However, CNodes will never connect directly to DBoxes / DNodes.  The diagram shows three DBoxes at the bottom of the diagram.  The DBoxes in this example includes dual redundant DTrays with two DNodes per Tray (four DNodes per DBox).  DNodes will only connect to the switch fabric and never connect directly to CBoxes, CNodes, or the customer's network.  All CNodes can access all NVMe media in all DBoxes exclusively through the switch fabric.  Adjust the Mock-up diagrams to reflect these architectural considerations.  Ask clarification questions if needed.

1. Most deployments connect at 100GbE, but VAST also supports 200GbE. 
2. Yes, that is correct.
3. For Rack diagrams, represent the single DBox.  For cable diagrams, represent DNodes with A & B ports.  Proper deployment will connect all DNode A ports (right-side port) to the lower A switch and all DNode B ports (left-side port) to the upper B switch.  The same port to switch orientation applies to the CNodes as well.
4. The customer network is a separate network.  The cluster supports connecting to the customer network from either secondary CNode NICs or switch MLAG connections.  In either case, the customer will not have backend access to the DBoxes/DNodes.
5. Your assessment is correct.  Recommend representing 4x CBoxes at the top  2x 32-port switches in the middle, and 4x DBoxes at the bottom as the example.  This is referred to as a 4x4 cluster.

For this diagram, make the following adjustments:
1. Position the switches side-by-side with Switch A on the Right
2. Show 2 connections from switch to switch
3. Connect each CBox to both Switch A & B and Change the line color to match connected Switch 
4. Connect each DBox to both Switch A & B and Change the line color to match connected Switch 
5. Remove lines drawn from the DBoxes to the bottom of the page
6. Connect Customer Network lines directly to Switch A & B

For this diagram, make the following adjustments:
1. Reduce switch height to 1U each with 1U of space between Switch A & B
2. Swap Switch A & B locations
3. Remove all network connection lines
4. Reduce DBox height to 1U each with 1U of space between lower switch and top DBox
5. Adjust CBoxes to leave 1U of space between upper switch and lower CBox
6. Change SBox to CBox
7. Change CBox numbering to start with 1 at the bottom & 4 at the top.  DBox numbering is correct

Remove the network ports images from Switch diagrams
Show 4 DBoxes
Change DBox numbering to DBox-100 starting with top DBox sequencially through DBox-103 at the bottom
CBoxes should be 2U each, Switches should be 1U each, and DBoxes should be 1U each.  Adjust the switches and DBoxes to half the height of the CBoxes
Adjust the Rack Hieght U numbering to lineup with each device and reflect the following Device Heights
31 CBox-4
30 CBox-4
29 CBox-3
28 CBox-3
27 CBox-2
26 CBox-2
25 CBox-1
24 CBox-1
23
22 Switch B
21
20 Switch A
19
18 DBox-100
17 DBox-101
16 DBox-102
15 DBox-103

Remove Duplicate DBox-4
Reduce DBox network connections to show only 1 line to Switch A and 1 line to Switch B
Reduce CBox network connections to show only 1 line to Switch A and 1 line to Switch B

Review the requirements and compare with the diagrams.  Revise until requirements are met.

Correct the rack layout diagram to meet the specified U positioning requirements and DBox-100 series numbering.

Revert to use vast_rack_layout_precise_final.png as it is the closest to being visually correct.
Adjust vast switch portmap diagram to correctly number each port. Top ports should be odd numbers from 1-31.  Bottom ports should all be even numbers from 2-32.

Integrate these finalized diagrams into the mock-up report and updated status.md log to current status.
