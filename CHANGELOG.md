## [1.2.0] - 2025-11-11

### Added
- **Hardware Inventory Node Column**: Replaced ID column with "Node" column showing programmatically generated CNode/DNode names
- **One Row Per Node**: Each CNode and DNode now appears on its own row for detailed tracking
- **Multiple Nodes Per Box Support**: CBoxes and DBoxes with multiple nodes display each node on a separate row with the same Name/Serial Number
- **Port Mapping Collection**: Enhanced port mapping collection via SSH with `--enable-port-mapping` flag
- **Port Mapping Credentials**: Support for switch and node SSH credentials via command-line arguments
- **Network Topology with Connections**: Network diagram now includes port mapping connections when available

### Changed
- **Column Renaming**:
  - "CNode/DNode" → "Node" (more concise)
  - "Position" → "Height" (clearer terminology)
- **Column Width Optimization**:
  - Model column: Increased from 30% to 40% for better readability
  - Rack column: Decreased from 10% to 8%
  - Node column: Decreased from 18% to 12%
  - Height column: Decreased from 10% to 8%
- **Node Name Source**: Now uses programmatically generated `name` field (e.g., `cnode-3-10`, `dnode-3-112`) instead of customer-assigned hostnames
- **Data Collection**: Enhanced CNode and DNode name extraction from API
- **DBox Association**: Improved DNode to DBox association with `dbox_id` field

### Fixed
- **Missing Name Field**: Fixed data extractor to include `name` field in processed hardware inventory data
- **Missing DBox ID**: Fixed DNode data structure to include `dbox_id` for proper DBox association
- **Dataclass Field Order**: Fixed `VastHardwareInfo` dataclass field ordering to resolve Python dataclass initialization errors

### Technical Details
- Updated `src/data_extractor.py`: Added `name` and `dbox_id` fields to `_process_hardware_node` method
- Updated `src/api_handler.py`: Added `hostname` field to `VastHardwareInfo` dataclass and hardware data structures
- Updated `src/report_builder.py`: Modified `_create_consolidated_inventory_table` to create one row per node
- Updated `src/brand_compliance.py`: Adjusted column width ratios for Hardware Inventory table
