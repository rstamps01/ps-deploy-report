### Current Project Phase

**Phase:** Core Functionality & Data Collection (Sprint 1)
**Sprint:** 1

---

### Last Completed Action

**Description:** Successfully completed Task 1.1.2: Development Environment Setup. Created Python virtual environment, installed all dependencies, created comprehensive environment validation script, and verified all systems are operational.
**Commit SHA:** [To be updated after commit]

### Next Immediate Task

**Objective:** Begin Task 1.1.3: Logging Infrastructure by implementing logging configuration in src/utils.py, creating log directory structure and rotation mechanism, and defining log message formats and levels as per the development guide.
**Relevant Files:**
- `/home/ubuntu/ps-deploy-report/src/utils.py` (to be created)
- `/home/ubuntu/ps-deploy-report/logs/` (already exists)
- `/home/ubuntu/ps-deploy-report/config/config.yaml` (logging section already configured)

**Specific Actions Required:**
1. Create `src/utils.py` with logging setup functions
2. Implement log file rotation and naming conventions
3. Create structured logging with proper formatting
4. Add log level configuration from config.yaml
5. Test logging functionality with sample messages
6. Create basic unit tests for logging module
