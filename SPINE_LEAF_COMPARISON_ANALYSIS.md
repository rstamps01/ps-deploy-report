- **QoS**: RoCE enabled, L3 trust (consistent)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Consistent configuration

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential Issues and Conflicts**

#### 1. **BGP Neighbor Configuration Mismatch**
**CRITICAL ISSUE**: The BGP neighbor configurations don't align properly:

**Spine Configuration**:
- Peers with VAST cluster on swp49-56 (numbered BGP)
- Peers with leaves on swp1-28 (unnumbered BGP)

**Leaf Configuration**:
- Peers with spines on swp21-28 (unnumbered BGP)
- No specific spine neighbor IPs configured

**Problem**: The leaf switches are configured to peer with spines on swp21-28, but the spine switches are configured to peer with leaves on swp1-28. This is a **port mapping mismatch**.

#### 2. **Missing Spine-Leaf BGP Neighbor Configuration**
**CRITICAL ISSUE**: The spine switches don't have specific BGP neighbor configurations for the leaf switches:

**Spine Configuration**:
- `nv set vrf default router bgp neighbor swp1-28 peer-group eBGP`
- `nv set vrf default router bgp neighbor swp1-28 type unnumbered`

**Leaf Configuration**:
- `nv set vrf default router bgp neighbor swp21-28 peer-group eBGP`
- `nv set vrf default router bgp neighbor swp21-28 type unnumbered`

**Problem**: The spine switches expect leaf connections on swp1-28, but leaves are configured to connect on swp21-28. This suggests a **cabling/port mapping issue**.

#### 3. **VRF Configuration Differences**
**POTENTIAL ISSUE**: Different VRF configurations between spine and leaf:

**Spine VRF RED**:
- No specific network advertisements
- Only aggregate routes: 10.71.196.0/23, 10.71.195.0/24

**Leaf VRF RED**:
- Advertises specific networks: 10.71.196.0/23, 10.71.195.0/24
- Has VRR configuration for VLANs 100 and 200

**Analysis**: This is actually correct - spines should aggregate routes, leaves should advertise specific networks.

#### 4. **Interface Configuration Mismatch**
**MINOR ISSUE**: Different interface usage patterns:

**Spine Interfaces**:
- swp1-28: Leaf connections (unnumbered BGP)
- swp49-56: VAST cluster connections (numbered BGP)

**Leaf Interfaces**:
- swp1-20: Server connections (bridge domain)
- swp21-28: Spine connections (unnumbered BGP)

**Analysis**: This suggests a specific cabling plan where:
- Spine swp1-28 connects to Leaf swp21-28
- This is a **port mapping mismatch** that needs to be resolved

### üîç **Detailed Port Mapping Analysis**

#### Expected Cabling (Based on Configurations)
**Spine ‚Üí Leaf Connections**:
- Spine swp1-28 ‚Üî Leaf swp21-28
- This creates a **port mapping mismatch**

#### Recommended Cabling
**Option 1: Update Leaf Configuration**
- Change leaf BGP neighbors from swp21-28 to swp1-28
- This would align with spine expectations

**Option 2: Update Spine Configuration**
- Change spine BGP neighbors from swp1-28 to swp21-28
- This would align with leaf expectations

**Option 3: Physical Cabling**
- Cable spine swp1-28 to leaf swp21-28
- This would match the current configurations

### üìã **Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention**

#### 1. **Port Mapping Mismatch**
- **Issue**: Spine expects leaf connections on swp1-28, leaves expect spine connections on swp21-28
- **Impact**: BGP sessions will not establish
- **Solution**: Either update configurations or physical cabling

#### 2. **Missing BGP Neighbor IPs**
- **Issue**: No specific BGP neighbor IPs configured for spine-leaf peering
- **Impact**: BGP sessions may not establish properly
- **Solution**: Configure specific neighbor IPs or ensure unnumbered BGP works

#### 3. **VRF Route Advertisement**
- **Issue**: Spines and leaves have different VRF configurations
- **Impact**: Routes may not be properly advertised
- **Solution**: Verify route advertisement is working as intended

### üéØ **Recommendations**

#### 1. **Immediate Actions**
1. **Resolve Port Mapping**: Choose one of the three options above to align port mappings
2. **Verify Physical Cabling**: Ensure cables are connected according to the chosen port mapping
3. **Test BGP Connectivity**: Verify BGP sessions establish between spines and leaves
4. **Validate Route Advertisement**: Ensure routes are properly advertised between spines and leaves

#### 2. **Configuration Updates**
1. **Standardize Port Mappings**: Choose a consistent port mapping strategy
2. **Add BGP Neighbor IPs**: Consider adding specific neighbor IPs for better control
3. **Verify VRF Configuration**: Ensure VRF configurations are compatible

#### 3. **Testing and Validation**
1. **BGP Session Testing**: Test BGP session establishment
2. **Route Advertisement Testing**: Verify routes are properly advertised
3. **Connectivity Testing**: Test end-to-end connectivity
4. **Failover Testing**: Test VRR failover scenarios

### üéØ **Summary**

**Overall Assessment**: The spine and leaf configurations are mostly compatible, but there are critical port mapping mismatches that will prevent proper BGP session establishment.

**Key Findings**:
- ‚úÖ Management network addressing is correct
- ‚úÖ BGP AS numbers are properly configured
- ‚úÖ EVPN/VXLAN configuration is consistent
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL**: Port mapping mismatch between spines and leaves
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL**: BGP sessions will not establish due to port mismatch
- ‚ö†Ô∏è VRF configurations are different but may be intentional

**Confidence Level**: 60% - Configurations are mostly sound but critical port mapping issues will prevent proper operation.

**Immediate Action Required**: Resolve the port mapping mismatch between spine swp1-28 and leaf swp21-28 before the network can function properly.
